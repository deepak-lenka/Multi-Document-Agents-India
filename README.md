# LLAMA Index README

## Overview

The LLAMA Index project aims to provide a tool for natural language understanding and information retrieval using various techniques including vector embeddings and summarization. This README file provides instructions on how to use the LLAMA Index codebase and its functionality.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- `llama_index` package
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Other Python packages as specified in `requirements.txt`

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Setup

API Key Configuration: To use the Anthropic API, set the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable to your API key:

import os
os.environ['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'] = 'your_anthropic_api_key_here'

model Configuration: Configure the LLAMA Index model and embedding model:

from llama_index.llms.anthropic import Anthropic
from llama_index.embeddings.huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbedding

llm = Anthropic(temperature=0.0, model='claude-3-opus-20240229')
embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name="BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5")

Data Preparation: If you need to prepare specific data for your analysis, follow the data preparation steps provided in the code.

Usage
